# Computer Vision - Image Basics with OpenCV and Python


In this project, it was possible to open an image with Matplotlib, change the colors of the image and rotate the image. Then, when opening an image with OpenCV, it was possible to learn the main points to remember when working with OpenCV, rotate the image and scale it to Gray. It was possible to create an image with Numpy and learn to draw lines, shapes and write text on them. 

## Main concepts
- Open an Image with Matplotlib,
- Open an Image with OpenCV,
- Learn the main points to remember for OpenCV,
- Change the Image's colour, size, orientation,
- Draw shapes and write text on an Image.
