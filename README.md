# Computer-Vision-Image-Basics-with-OpenCV-and-Python
At this project, you will learn how to open an image with Matplotlib, change the colours of the image and rotate the image. Then you'll open an image with OpenCV, learn the main points to keep in mind when working with OpenCV, flip the image, scale it to Gray. Create an image with Numpy and learn how to draw lines, shapes and write text on them.
